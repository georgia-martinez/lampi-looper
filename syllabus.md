## Course Description

This course provides students with a practical, hands-on introduction to connected devices and systems (aka Internet of Things - IoT).  Student pairs design and build a complete connected device system, gaining hands-on experience with device (embedded), cloud/web, and mobile software development and wireless communication technologies.  Students also develop experience with non-functional, system topics including analytics, scaling and load testing, remote device update, and essential security.  The course has a heavy lab component.

The hands-on nature of this IoT course will, by necessity, involve a wide variety of programming languages, systems, and technologies.  Given the time constraints, none of these can be explored in detail, but we hope to impart an overall systems understanding of how Connected Device systems can be architected and built, as well as introduce students to major systems components and concepts.

We will be exploring this space through a simple hardware product, whose functionality will evolve throughout the semester, as we integrate it with "the cloud" and mobile applications, as well as explore systems topics, such as security and analytics.

We hope that by the end of the semester students will:

* have developed a systems level understanding of Connected Devices
* have enough understanding to dive deeper into the technology of any of the components
* have sufficient experience to prototype a product or concept idea of their own

This a 3 Credit Hour course.

## Textbook

The materials for this class have been developed specifically for this course.  Students will access the courseware (source code, configuration, hypertext textbook in Markdown) via Git.

Knowledge of Linux, Git, and Python are recommended.

As a starting point, here are a few Git resources that might be useful:

* [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com)
* [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/)
* [GitHub Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

and a few Python resources that might be useful:

* [The Official Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/)
* [Learn Python in 10 minutes](http://www.korokithakis.net/tutorials/python/)
* [Learn Python the hard way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/)

## Course Content and Requirements

Lectures will be given twice per week.  Students are expected to attend all lectures and participate in discussions.  Students will be responsible for all material covered in class and in the Courseware.  

We will be covering a wide variety of technologies, including Embedded Systems, Cloud (using Amazon Web Services - AWS), Bluetooth Low Energy (aka Bluetooth Smart) and native mobile applications, as well as non-functional systems topics including analytics, load testing, security, firmware update, etc.

## Grading Policy

(A: 90-100%, B: 80-90%, C: 70-80%, D: 60-70%, F: 0-60%)  
_curve possible at instructor's discretion_

There will be weekly quizzes, weekly lab assignment, and a final project.  

Final grades will be based on:

* 5% - Weekly Quizzes
* 85% - Weekly Assignments
* 10% - Final Project

The weekly assignments will be challenging.

We strongly believe in the concept of Pairing as a useful practice for learning - two developers/designers/engineers working closely together, sharing a keyboard, talking through problems and possible solutions, and teaching and learning from each other.

Students will be paired for each assignment.

* Assignments grades will be based on:
    1. A brief, in-class demonstration of the required functionality, plus a short video as a backup
    2. A brief write-up, capturing relevant output (e.g., source code, photos/videos demonstrating required functionality, etc.)
    3. Review of your software.
* Late assignments will not be accepted.
* All projects *must conform* to the guidelines given in the assignments (e.g., program name, particular function names, output format if specified, etc.).
* Students will work in pairs, and will receive the same grade for each assignment.
* If a student feel that their current pairing is not working, please contact the instructor _immediately_.

## Course Ethics and Policies

* _All work turned in should be that of your own pair._
* Study groups are encouraged, but, again,
* _Again, All work turned in should be that of your own pair._
* Neither copy another student's work nor allow your work to be copied, other than your pair.
* The instructor has zero tolerance for plagiarism.
* Any malicious use or intentional misuse of the LAMPI kits, development servers or other resources will be dealt with most harshly.

### CWRU

#### Academic Integrity Policy

All students in this course are expected to adhere to University standards of academic integrity. Cheating, plagiarism, misrepresentation, and other forms of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to, consulting with another person during an exam, turning in written work that was prepared by someone other than you, making minor modifications to the work of someone else and turning it in as your own, or engaging in misrepresentation in seeking a postponement or extension. Ignorance will not be accepted as an excuse. If you are not sure whether something you plan to submit would be considered either cheating or plagiarism, it is your responsibility to ask for clarification.  For complete information, please go to [http://bulletin.case.edu/undergraduatestudies/academicintegrity/](http://bulletin.case.edu/undergraduatestudies/academicintegrity/)

#### CWRU Disability Resources

ESS Disability Resources is committed to assisting all CWRU students with disabilities by creating opportunities to take full advantage of the University's educational, academic, and residential programs.
